I thought I would make a post announcing good news, notifying you all of changes in my life, and finally, thanking you all for your support.\
\
Earlier in the holiday the University of York notified me that they would be graduating me with a First Class Honours (with distinction) in BEng Computer Science (with a year in industry). Following on from this, I was also notified that the University of Leeds will be accepting me, with an offer of full academic studentship, for an MSc in High Performance Graphics and Games Engineering, a subject close to my heart, for 2020/2021.\
\
I have always tried to make the most out of every opportunity available to me, but I would not have been able to do nearly as well as I have without the immense support of all of my friends, colleagues, and family. I am extremely thankful for all the support I have received to this point, and will ensure it is not wasted going forward.\

Thank you all.
